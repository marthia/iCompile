# iCompile
a simple compiler in Android(kotlin), which gives java bytecode. 
it has a lexer for tokenization and a parser to create parse trees 
and finally a constrainer to walk all trees and generate the final byteCode

The master branch is based on a non-Android Java project and can be found here: https://github.com/T-mclennan/Simple-Java-Compiler.git 
But the sCompiler branch is a completely different approach written from scratch which is more intuitive than the master branch. if you want just to learn the basics of compiler design and don't want to stuck in advanced theories you can try this branch instead. it's very clean.
